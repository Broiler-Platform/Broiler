# DOCX Conformance

`Broiler.Documents.Docx` reads and writes a dependency-free DOCX subset using
Open XML WordprocessingML package parts.

## Supported Read/Write Subset

- Main document package discovery through `_rels/.rels` with fallback to
  `word/document.xml`.
- Paragraphs, empty paragraphs, tabs, and soft line breaks.
- Direct inline formatting: bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, font
  family, font size, foreground color, and background shading.
- Paragraph formatting: left/center/right alignment, line spacing, spacing
  before/after, indentation, bullet lists, and numbered lists.
- External hyperlinks for `http`, `https`, and `mailto`, plus internal anchor
  links.

## Intentional Limits

- Styles, themes, tracked deletions, embedded objects, images, fields, comments,
  headers, footers, footnotes, tables, and section layout are skipped or
  approximated with diagnostics where applicable.
- DOCX packages above `DocumentLimits.MaxDocumentBytes` are not parsed.
- XML parts above `DocumentLimits.MaxBinBytes` are skipped.
- Color alpha is not represented by DOCX; RGB channels are written with a
  diagnostic.

## Probe Policy

DOCX probing is conservative because DOCX is a ZIP-based OPC package:

- ZIP signature plus DOCX filename/MIME hint is high confidence.
- A visible `word/document.xml` local ZIP entry is high confidence.
- Generic ZIP files are not claimed without a DOCX hint or WordprocessingML
  package evidence.
